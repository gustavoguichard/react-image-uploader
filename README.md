react-image-uploader
=====================

React component to display an image preview of an `<input type='file'>`.

### Usage

```
import ImageUploader from 'imageuploader'

<ImageUploader id="img-upload" />
```

Then, customize the look and feel with CSS. Everything is wrapped in a `image-uploader` class and when an image is selected there's a temporary `loading` class to help your styling.
